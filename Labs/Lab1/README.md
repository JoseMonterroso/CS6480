# Lab Assignment 1: Cloud Computing and Network Function Virtualization

There are three goals associated with this assignment. First is to introduce students to the POWDER testbed infrastructure [9, 7]. The second is to explore aspects of cloud computing by experimenting with the Docker platform as a service framework [1]. The third is to use the Docker environment together with the Quagga open source routing suite [6] to explore basic network functions virtualization (NFV) concepts [2, 3]. A side effect of the third goal will be a review and practical application of basic routing concepts.

For the final part of this assignment you will be required to realize a simple NFV-enabled routed network and to develop a basic OSPF NFV “orchestrator”’ to perform dynamic, zero-impact, network modifications.
