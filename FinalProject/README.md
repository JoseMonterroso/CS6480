# Final Project: Radio Frequency Validation on the POWDER platform

### Abstract

Recently developed technologies and frameworks at the POWDER platform accelerate learning and innovate new forms of networking research. On the other hand it is unclear how well these frameworks are performing and whether they meet their evaluation standards.

In this paper, we uncover the Shout framework. Shout is a framework developed by the POWDER team to perform a variety of measurement studies on the platform. For our purposes we will use Shout to perform radio frequency propagation measurements on the POWDER nodes. To compare these results we will use an open source radio frequency propagation modeling tool named SPLAT!. Due to the uncalibrated nature of the radios on POWDER we will use the path loss exponent as a form of assessment between the two. Furthermore, we will do a small terrain analysis of a chosen measurement frequency to bring our results to the physical world and explain why we got the results we did.

### Here is all the material related to my final project in CS 6480: 

The 'Paper' folder holds the latex files of my final paper copy.

The 'RelatedWorks' folder contains all the PDFs of related works cited in my paper.

The 'StatusUpdates' folder contains the weekly progress reports.

The 'SPLAT!Files' folder contains a few of the necessary LRP and QTH files to get SPLAT! working for the POWDER platform.

The 'Presentation' folder holds a copy of my presentation slides.

The 'Parsers' folder contains the parers I created to help me parse data between the open-source Shout measurement framework, SPLAT!, and R Studio.

The 'Data' folder holds all the sample data collections for both Shout and Splat! at the given frequencies. Each frequency also holds an R file to produce plots.
