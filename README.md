# CS6480 - Advanced Computer Networks

CS 6480 is a graduate level course on computer networking with a systems emphasis. The course involves a taught component, two lab assignments and a term course project. The taught component of the course will focus on advanced networking topics by studying a combination of classic research papers as well as current and  emerging topics in computer networking. Specific focus areas will include cloud computing, network function virtualization and network programmability, network architectures and protocols, and network measurement and management. The lab assignments will be broadly focused on network programmability and with a specific aim of providing hands-on exposure to networking software stacks. The two lab assignments will respectively focus on network orchestration and radio access network programmability. Term course projects will be expected to address a real networking problem and to form the basis for a possible conference/workshop paper or poster submission. Projects will be chosen from a wide range of networking related topics and can include analysis, measurement, simulation or implementation. The course is suitable for Masters and PhD students (and strong undergraduate students) wishing togain hands-on exposure to network systems and/or students wanting to explore or engage in networking related research.

There are three objectives for this course. First is to give students hands-on exposure to cutting edge networking and systems technologies in the context of a number of different tools/environments that might be used for networking and systems research. Second is to introduce students to emerging networking research and technology trends by studying a combination of classic and current networking and systems research papers. Third is to give students a flavor of networking research by having them engage ina small research project.

There are two goals associated with the lab assignments. The first is to give students some experience  with “tools” that are useful in networking and systems research. The second is to give students hands-on exposure to some of the focus areas of the course. Two equally weighted lab assignments are currently planned: (i) Cloud Computing and Network FunctionVirtualization. (ii) Radio Access Network programmability.

“Default” homework assignments will consist of (a) summaries of papers as-signed for reading and (b) summaries of class discussion of those papers. These default homework assignments will be due in a two step process as follows: First, summaries of papers are due before the class in which the paper is discussed. Second, the summary of the class discussion of the paper will be due before the next scheduled class.  A LaTeX template will be provided for these assignments.

Course projects present a significant part of the course. Projects should address a significant networking problem and be done in groups of two. Individual projects or groups of no more than three will also be allowed with instructor permission. In the latter case the scope of the problem being addressed will be expected to be adjusted proportionally.  A list of possible projects will be made availablefor students to choose from.  The list will take the form of a brief project description, some pointers to start exploring related work and the names of individuals willing to act as mentors for the project. Mentors are typically the originators of the idea and students are expected to meet with them during the execution ofthe project. With instructor approval, students can also suggest and work on their own project ideas. The final project deliverable will be a short paper in conference/workshop style that, as a minimum, presents a clear problem definition and motivation, related work, proposed solution and some initial results and/or steps towards a solution. As such the project report paper should be suitable for submission to a workshop or a poster session at a conference. While actual submission of the project work to a workshop or conference is not a requirement, the paper should be written to “fit” an actual workshop or conference call for papers (CFP). Finally, at the end of the semester each project group will be expected to briefly present their project inclass.
