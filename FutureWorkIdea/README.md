# Future Work Idea

For this assignment you need to pick one of the papers you read during this course and develop *one* of your ideas for possible future work. Or a new idea for future work inspired by the class discussion or your increased insight into the problem. The idea has to be related though to one of the papers we read or one of the focus areas for this course (cloud computing, network function virtualization and network programmability, network architectures and protocols, and network measurement and management).

With “develop” I mean the following: come up with the kernel of an idea which you think might become a network systems related research project. You can look at the projects.txtPreview the document file which we used earlier in the semester for examples.

Note that these project ideas typically:

- describe a problem

- describe a possible solution (project goal)

- describe an approach towards that goal

- provide references related to either the problem or the planned solution.
