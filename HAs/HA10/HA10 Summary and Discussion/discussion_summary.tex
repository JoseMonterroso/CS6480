\section*{Discussion summary}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\it Summary:} Summarize the class discussion of the papers. Note in
particular anything that came out of the discussion that you missed in your
reading, or that made you change your mind. 

\item {\it Strengths and weaknesses:} Note the consensus
in the class, or your own new insights, regarding the strengths and
weaknesses of the paper(s).

\item {\it Connection with other work:} Describe any connections that were made in
the class discussion to other papers (with citations). (Or connections that you realized
as a result of the class discussion.)

\item {\it Future work:} Briefly describe any possibilities
for future work that came out of the discussion and/or were triggered

\begin{comment}
The bus via IP
	=> and using web-based technologies 
	=> all the VF can talk to each other 
	=> in 4G the interfaces were not HTTP they had other protocols 
	
LTE is just the radio network (eNB to the Core)


In NSA
	=> they add the gNB
	=> Might still want LTE for legacy users and 
	
Dual connectivity
	=> can the device do that
	=> policy descission to allow duel connectivity 
	
Primary Authentication - Normal authentication UE wakes up and exchanges credential(keys) with the network 
Secondary Authentication - separate mobile network authentication 

Network domain security - security between the components 

Integrity protection will be optional 

BSS - business markets the technology
	=> not a set framework 
OSS - backend orchestration

Catalogs - Services to provide some time of service, in the calog there will be a recipe of how we can capture that
	=> what we have to offer 

Inventories -  resoources at a give time. knowing what is going on
	=> load at a given time 
	=> list of resources 
	
Looking close loops 

Figure 15 - Transport network
	=> GnodeB or Mobile back haul network 
	=> flexible to move the 5G core closer to the edge 


future work
	=> secondary authentication - 
	=> measurement studies - 4G vs 5G latency and handover
	=> sdn SDRs, dynamically adjust the ntwork 
	=> Onap automated and instantiated 
	=>
