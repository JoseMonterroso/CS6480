MILCOM - Milititary IEEE conference 

IEEE  conferencing in networking are the next level down from SIGCOM ACM
	=> However it depends on the area that you are in 
	
Paper is geared towards introduction too NDN 
	=> felt like a marketing verb: "NDN is great here is why" but don't really explain the new issues of NDN
	
Networks ship data around 

Claim: 2 fundamental things
	=> namespaces
	=> and mechanisms 
	
I failed to see how this can replace the internet globally
	=> Could be good for small network
	
Using application layer names in the networking layer 
	=> Is it a good thing to do this?
	
Communication patterns - whose making request; when and how many 

You create content and but using names you don't know where that name will be
	=> yoou need to impose some constraints with appropriating namespace designs
	
The forwarding nodes maintain state
	=> that is how they get away from having addresses
	=> Make the nettwork more 

Better with denial of service

DDOS - can still work for NDN 
	=> multiple interests
	
Data synchrnonousation - two parties that sync up 
s
