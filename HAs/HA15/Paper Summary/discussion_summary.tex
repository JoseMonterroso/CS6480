\begin{comment}
CoNEXT is an ACM conference
	=> Top tier conference 
	=> slightly less than CoNEXT
	
FlexRAN
	=> increase in data and signaling traffic is the motivation 
	=> Invisible to the UE, the implication is a good thing
	=> not a new Idea, but only implementation 
	
Why put related works first?
	=> if you are worried if people are gonna say is this the same?
		=> say hey this is related but I did so and so different in my paper 
		
API on the bottom
	=> you can swap out eNodeB with other things
	
Apps that the operator provides or third party apps
	=> veted app 
	
They emphasized real time aspects 

The design challenges felt like design goals
	
O-RAN
	=> similar kind of idea to SD-RAN
	=> Orchestration and automation
	=> RAN intelligent controller - similar to SD-RAN
	=> you still have control plane devices within themselves
		=> but you can override what happens in the equipment level
