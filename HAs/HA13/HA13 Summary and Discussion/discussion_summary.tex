SOSR - published symposium of SDN research 
	=> ACM sponsored 
	
CUPS  improvement
	=> when you do this separation, of course these things don't have to be instantiated on the same place 
	
two main motivations
	=> more signaling procedures 

optimizing the common case
	=> offloading offloadable signaling functions too tthe 
	
Good challenges in the approach 
	=> 3 listed challenges 
	
The things that are offloadable are user specific 
	=> UE specific 
	=> no global state 
	
S/P - GWs figure 2 (b) separation leaves you with the same IP address 
	=> similar too tunnels 
	=> EX. if something on the internet wants to send me data ???
		=> THE P GATeway will signal with the MME then the MME will page the UE to wake up 
		
TurboEPC wants to change the eNB
	- there are at least 100,000 thousands eNB
